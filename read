Node Upgrade
We will occasional upgrade and patch the ITN with new features and patches to improve the overall network.

To make the upgrade process as flawless as possible, we will update the ITN installer script from time to time. This script can be ran in a non-destructive way, meaning it changes only what is needed. It will gracefully shut down Rusk for you.

To upgrade to the latest ITN version, run:

Terminal window
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://github.com/dusk-network/itn-installer/releases/download/v0.1.9/itn-installer.sh | sudo sh

Once it’s done and gives no errors, start Rusk again:

Terminal window
service rusk start

If everything is up and running again, query the node a couple of times to see if the block height is progressing:

Terminal window
ruskquery block-height

Or keep an eye on the logs to see if it’s making and accepting new blocks:

Terminal window
tail -F /var/log/rusk.log

If you see new blocks being accepted, you’re up and running again. Is your node stuck, or are you not sure if it is?

You can see the status of the Rusk service here:

Terminal window
service rusk status

If it is not running after starting it, and reports an error, you can check your logs to see if something is wrong, like a wrong password or no peers being found:

Terminal window
tail -n 30 /var/log/rusk.log
